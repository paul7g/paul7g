"HelloWorld!" Im Paul, I wanted to start this GitHub because I needed a place to put all my IT projects that I am working on.  
I have an interest in coding specifically Python and HTML/CSS, and I have a passion for IT mainly in networking.Recently I have been working on packet tracer builds so that some day soon I can create my own home wifi network.
I mainly started this as a way to get noticed for jobs as I am currently looking for employment, I thought IT projects would be my best bet.
Thank you for taking a look at my profile and offering any critisims of anykind, if you are a recuriter who enjoys my work feel free to reach out thanks a ton!
